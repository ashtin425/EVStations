# EVStations
In this project, I did some sql queries on a kaggle dataset containing EV station information for the United States and Canada. After downloading the dataset, I made a list of some questions I wanted to answer with the information I recieved from the data set. My questions were;

- What are the top states w/ charging stations?
- What are the top cities w/ charging stations?
- What is the most common facility type for charging stations?
- How many EV charging stations have opened in the past 10 years?

After asking myself these questions, I began creating some SQL queries to find answers. Firstly, I got rid of the anything outside of the US since I was only looking for information inside the United States. After that, I wrote the queries and was surprsied by some of the things I found. With top states, it was no surprise seeing California having the top spot, but the thing that jumped out to me was that Atlanta was a top 4 city when it came to most EV stations! Also hotels being the leader in facilities with stations, just in front of car dealerships is a bit surprising to me. I also created a visualiztaion in Tableau showing the information I discovered, you can see it here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ashtin4783/viz/EVStationsintheUnitedStates/Dashboard1?publish=yes
